/* aarch64 half of GRUB's relocator contract.
 *
 * The i386 version declares grub_relocator16/32/64_state and the
 * matching *_boot entry points, each carrying the register state the
 * target architecture is entered with. aarch64 upstream has neither.
 * This header follows the same shape, with the register set aarch64
 * actually has: x0-x2 (the ARM64 boot protocol's argument registers,
 * x0 being the device tree or, for the xnu loader, the boot-parameter
 * block) plus sp and pc.
 *
 * otos-coreinit's include/boot_protocol.h uses three inputs
 * (x0=raw FDT, x1=init's already-resolved entry point,
 * x2=InitDescription ptr). This is this
 * project's own copy of this header (not upstream GRUB's, which has
 * no aarch64 relocator at all), so extending it is a safe, local
 * change, not a fork of something otherwise shared.
 *
 * grub_relocator64_boot is the faithful counterpart of i386's
 * grub_relocator32_boot: it takes the relocator, the register state,
 * and the avoid-EFI-boot-services flag, and does not return on success.
 * That is what lets loader/arm64/otos_grub.c read like loader/i386/xnu.c --
 * build the parameters, fill in a state, call the boot entry. */
