/* aarch64 relocator: the allocation half only.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. grub-core/loader/xnu.c -- the portable half of GRUB's
 * xnu loader -- allocates the kernel's heap region through the relocator
 * API: grub_relocator_new, grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_addr,
 * get_virtual_current_address, grub_relocator_unload. GRUB ships that
 * API for i386, x86_64, mips, powerpc, ieee1275 and xen, and NOT for
 * arm64 (grub-core/lib/arm64/ contains only setjmp.S). Without it the
 * portable loader cannot compile on this architecture at all, which is
 * the real reason xnu was x86-only -- not any x86-ness in the loader
 * itself.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, STATED PLAINLY. A relocator's job on x86 is to move the
 * running GRUB image out of the way and enter a kernel through a
 * carefully built low-level state. On aarch64 we do not need that: the
 * kernel is entered directly by the arch half (see loader/arm64/xnu.c),
 * with firmware already exited. What the portable loader still needs is
 * only the ALLOCATION service -- "give me a chunk of physical memory at
 * this address, mapped where I can write to it now". That is what this
 * file implements, and nothing else.
 *
 * The chunk list is a simple free-list over allocations made through
 * grub_efi_allocate_pages_real, so a chunk's virtual address (where
 * GRUB writes) and its target physical address (where the kernel will
 * find it) are the same value under EFI's identity mapping at this
 * stage -- which is exactly the property the portable loader assumes
 * when it writes through get_virtual_current_address and hands the
 * numerical address to the kernel. */
